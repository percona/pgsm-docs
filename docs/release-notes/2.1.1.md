# Version 2.1.1 ({{date.2_1_1}})

 [Install `pg_stat_monitor`](../install.md){.md-button}

## Release highlights

This release fixes the deadlock that occurs when the error handler tries to log the error while `pg_stat_monitor` still holds the LWLock. It was fixed by forcefully releasing the lock prior to logging an error.

## Improvements

* [PG-1349](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PG-1349) - Fixed the deadlock in `pg_stat_monitor` .
