# Version 2.3.1 ({{date.2_3_1}})

 [Install `pg_stat_monitor`](../install.md){.md-button}

## Release highlights

This release adds compatibility with PostgreSQL 18 and introduces three new monitoring metrics for improved visibility into write-ahead log (WAL) and parallel workers.

!!! important
    The previous PGSM 2.3.0 version is considered to be unreleased, please use the current 2.3.1 version instead.

## Improvements

- Fixed a memory consumption issue that could lead to an assertion failure and cause server crashes in some workloads.

Added the following new metrics:

- **wal_buffers_full**, counts the number of times the WAL buffers became full
- **parallel_workers_to_launch**, tracks the number of planned parallel workers
- **parallel_workers_launched**, tracks the number of parallel workers actually launched

These metrics align with equivalent values in `pg_stat_statements`.

## Bug fixes

[PG-2005](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PG-2005) - Fixed a crash in `pg_stat_monitor` caused by exceeding internal stack depth during parsing of deeply nested statements.
