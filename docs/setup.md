# Set up `pg_stat_monitor`

After you [installed `pg_stat_monitor`](install.md), you must set it up to use it.

## 1. Load the module

Load `pg_stat_monitor` at the start time by adding it to the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter. This is because `pg_stat_monitor` requires additional shared memory.

1. Connect to `psql` and modify the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter using the [ALTER SYSTEM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html) command. 

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor';
    ```

    > **NOTE**: If youâ€™ve added other modules to the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter (for example, `pg_stat_statements`), list all of them separated by commas for the `ALTER SYSTEM` command. 
    >
    >`pg_stat_monitor` **must** follow `pg_stat_statements`. For example, `ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'foo, pg_stat_statements, pg_stat_monitor'`.

    !!! warning
   
        It's make sence to disable application name tracking as it's expensive feature and may cause perfomance degradation proportional to connections number.

        ```sql
        ALTER SYSTEM SET pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_track_application_names = 'no';
        ```
   

3. Start or restart the `postgresql` instance to apply the changes.

    === "On Debian and Ubuntu"

        ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
        $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql.service
        ```

    === "On Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives"

        ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
        $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql-XXX
        ```
        
        Replace the `XXX` with the PostgreSQL version you are using.

After you have  added `pg_stat_monitor` to the `shared_preload_libraries`,  it starts collecting statistics data for all existing databases. To access this data, you need to [create the view](#2-create-the-extension-view) on every database that you wish to monitor. 

## 2. Create the extension view

Create the extension view with the user that has the privileges of a superuser or a database owner. Connect to `psql` as a superuser for a database and run the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command:


```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor;
```

After the setup is complete, you can see the stats collected by `pg_stat_monitor`.

By default, `pg_stat_monitor` is created for the `postgres` database. To access the statistics from other databases, you need to create the extension view for every database. 

!!! note

    When you create a new database `newdb`, `pg_stat_monitor` captures the statistics metrics, yet you cannot see them because the `pg_stat_monitor` view is not accessible for it. You can see the metrics for the `newdb` database either when you query it from the existing database `mydb` or after you explicitly create the `pg_stat_monitor` view for the `newdb` database.

    To reduce this manual work, see the [How to automatically make the `pg_stat_monitor` view accessible for every newly created database](auto-enable.md) guide.
